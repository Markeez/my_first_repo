            <p id="bold">Concept</p>
            <p>During our UX-program we had the assignment to create a prototype for an energy company. The goal was to create 11 different prototypes for mobile and desktop, where each prototype was based on a specific function related to a user story. The main goal was to work in an agile approach and update the prototypes with each sprint.</p>

        <p id="bold">Analysis & brainstorming</p>
        <p>We worked according to the SCRUM-model where each member of the team had the opportunity to act as a SCRUM-master for at least one of the sprints. The first prototypes were created in Figma after doing a bit of Competitive Analysis and brainstorming sessions around the user stories.</p>

            <p id="bold">Agile workflow</p>
            <p>After each sprint the team had a retrospective and discussed what worked well and what could be improved. I learned that sometimes it was important not to lean in too hard into some improvements, for example too much discussion and brainstorming could halt the progression, as well as the importance of not overworking certain concepts and functions.</p>

        <p>During a a later course in the program there was an opportunity to use the prototypes in order to create personas based on a specific target groups. This specific persona was then used to create several customer journey maps which were presented to highlight pain points that were observed from testing the prototypes.</p>

        <p id="bold">Persona & Customer Journey mapping</p>
        <p>During our usability testing sessions there was a lot of feedback concerning the terminology and the abundance of options in the prototypes, especially in regard to the sign-up process for the service. What I’ve learned from this was to try and streamline and simplify the process. It’s important to not confuse the user and make sure that they don’t get frustrated and abort the process. The results of the customer journey mapping revealed similar results where there were several pain points related to confusion. What I’ve learned from that was to try and compile similar functions on the same page in order to present the user with all the available options and avoid unnesescary clicks and cumbersome navigation.</p>
